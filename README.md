## Task - Lab 6 - Front-end

Create a client-side only web app on a free topic. (Topic should be [discussed with the teacher](mailto:dragos.strainu@isa.utm.md?subject=WEB-LAB6%20Topic%20approval)).

Description and flows of the app should be written in README.md

### Client requirements

- Have some kind of entities that can be manipulated (add/remove/like/filter)
  - example of entities: Books, Workouts, Movies, Students, Events, ...
- Have a custom theme/style (you can use css libraries but customize them to the needs)
  - Should have light/dark version
- App should be accesible with a public link
- **Additional requirements will be asked on spot (if the app will be too simple)**

### Dev requirements

- Use one of [front-end frameworks/libraries](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/)
- All app state should be in runtime, some state should be stored in the browser (IndexedDB, localStorage)
- Have a decent git history to track the progress (`-2 points` if not respected)
  - You will be asked to checkout through commits to show working app at diferent stages
- App should be hosted on Github Pages (or similar static web apps hosting)

### Other requirements

- See [submission requirements](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/assign/view.php?id=48603)
